# ☕ Kapeez - Cafe Ordering System (JavaFX)

**Kapeez** is a simple cafe ordering system built using **JavaFX**.  
It was the updated version of my cafe ordering system as part of our programming course to simulate a real-world coffee shop experience.

Users can select drinks, view their orders, and generate a digital receipt.
